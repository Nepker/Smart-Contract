Creating a Solana Token Using CLI::
What Do You Need?
A computer…and a terminal

    Mac, Windows, Linux…it doesn’t matter.
        On Windows, we will be using WSL2…what is that? Check it out here —-> https://youtu.be/vxTW22y8zV8?si=qzu9YrxSFFnXwSLM

Docker

    Docker is my favorite way to deploy pretty much anything. It’s available on all platforms and very easy to install.

Mac - Docker Install

    Link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/

Linux/Windows (WSL) - Docker Install

    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ (link for all other distros)
    If you are using Ubuntu (primary OS or WSL), do this:
        here is the link to documentation: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Setup Docker’s apt repo

# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

Install the latest Docker version

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

Make sure it works

sudo docker run hello-world

Setup the Solana Docker Container
Create a new folder for your token project

mkdir your-token-name

## jump in there

cd  your-token-name

Create a Dockerfile

    This will walk you through how to create a Dockerfile, a file that will help you create your own Docker image.

## Use nano to create a file

nano Dockerfile

## Copy and paste the Dockerfile code below. Use ctrl-x-enter to save.

Dockerfile

# Use a lightweight base image
FROM debian:bullseye-slim

# Set non-interactive frontend for apt
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install required dependencies and Rust
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config nano \
    && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Add Rust to PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

# Verify Rust installation
RUN rustc --version

# Install Solana CLI
RUN curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install | sh \
    && echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Add Solana CLI to PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Verify Solana CLI installation
RUN solana --version

# Set up Solana config for Devnet
RUN solana config set -ud

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /solana-token

# Default command to run a shell
CMD ["/bin/bash"]

Build the Docker Image

    We’re building our Docker image now with the Dockerfile we just created. We’re naming the image heysolana

docker build -t heysolana .

Run the Container

    Now we are creating a docker container with this image (and running it). Using the -it switch will throw us right into the container.
    The -v options are mapping our current directory inside the docker container so that all the work we do will be saved.
    We are naming the Docker container heysolana

docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/solana-token -v $(pwd)/solana-data:/root/.config/solana heysolana

Create a fake Solana Token

    We’re creating a token on the Solana devnet.
    Why?
    We can brake stuff, it’s free, and this might be where you will stop. You can do everything the mainnet can do, it is just considered a testing environment and you can’t buy or sell tokens here. BUT…you can send and receive tokens. So, if that’s all you care about, this is where you can leave off.

Create an account for mint authority

    This will be the account that will own the token we’re creating.
    This is also a Solana wallet. You can send and receive Solana tokens with this wallet, or account.
    Here we are creating an account that will start with dad because it’s the daddy of our new token, the boss.

solana-keygen grind --starts-with dad:1

Set the account as the default keypair

    With this command we are telling the Solana CLI to use this new account we just created as the default account for whatever we are doing.

solana config set --keypair dad-your-token-acount.json

Change to devnet

    With this command we are changing to the Solana devnet for this token.

solana config set --url devnet

Verify your config

    This will output your current Solana CLI config

solana config get

Get some SOL from a faucet

    In order to mint new tokens, send tokens…etc..on the Solana network, you’ll need SOL to power it.
    On the mainnet you would need to buy actual SOL but on the devnet, you can just wish for it and a magic genie gives you some.
    Go out to this URL https://faucet.solana.com/ to have SOL airdropped to the account you just created. What’s your account address?

## Run this to find your solana address
solana address

    Paste your solana address in the field and enter an amount of SOL you want. 2.5 will be MORE than enough.

    If you see this message, you are solid.

    Check your solana balance to make sure it arrived okay.

Create a mint address

    Yes, we are creating another account.
    This will be your mint address, the factory that will make your token.
    It will also be the official address of your token and how you will always know it’s the right token.
    We’re going to create it starting with mnt so we know it’s our mint address.

solana-keygen grind --starts-with mnt:1

Now, let’s mint our TOKEN!!!!

    This is using the default token program from Solana with the –progam-id switch
    We’re enabling metadata with –enable-metadata, you know, pictures and stuff
    Decimals? With the –decimals switch, we are defining how many decimal places our token can have. It specifies how many fractional units a token can have. 9 is what SOL uses…so it should be good enough for us.
    Make sure to include your own mint address below.

spl-token create-token \
--program-id TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb \
--enable-metadata \
--decimals 9 \
mnt-your-mint-address.json

    You’ll see an output like this
    I would screenshot or copy and paste this, keep it somewhere safe.

!Image Description

    Notice that my token address is the same as my mint address

Upload Metadata

    Now, we are going to upload the metadata of our token, things like the name, symbol and the icon.
    Let’s start with our token icon. Make sure it is:
        Square
        either 512x512 or 1024x1024
        less than 100kb

!Image Description
Upload Image to some sort of online storage

    Since we are doing decentralized things, it would be nice to store our stuff on decentralized storage. I tried Pinata and I like it.
        —> https://app.pinata.cloud/
        Create an account and upload your image

    Go to IPFS Files

!Image Description

    Upload your file !Image Description

    Open your file and copy the URL. It should look something like this. Put it somewhere, we’re about to use it.

https://salmon-effective-mosquito-301.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreigaiqsulww3fulikwx5ho2ifpfqfnco5bhqs4ui5gk5rn4ggkjuoy
Create Metadata file

    Create a file with this format, filling in your details.
    Name can be anything you want
    Symbol is the short version, like a stock symbol.
    The image will be the url we just copied from our image upload process. If you don’t have one, feel free to use mine.

Save this as a json file

## Create the file

nano metadata.json

## Copy and paste the metadata stuff

{
  "name": "Beard Coin",
  "symbol": "BEARD",
  "description": "Just a cool little coin, just for me.",
  "image": "https://salmon-effective-mosquito-301.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreigaiqsulww3fulikwx5ho2ifpfqfnco5bhqs4ui5gk5rn4ggkjuoy"
}

Upload this metadata file to Pinata

    Same steps as before. Upload to Pinata and copy the url.

!Image Description
Add the metadata to the token

    Now, time to upload our metadata. This will actually go on chain….which is pretty off the chain…..
    Notice our token address is given without the .json
    Then we specify our coin name
    And then our symbol. I know, this is probably redundant…but we’re making sure the job gets done.
    And finally, the url to our metadata.

spl-token initialize-metadata \
mnteyhFCjqLu5QwfXmEu49dGybyFN5dwPfAhoiMbjNw \
"Beard Coin" \
"BEARD" \
https://salmon-effective-mosquito-301.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreiamyf4f4iijqd2rp7phlqcdt4xoml2nfpeubavfyvwmi2vxpywawe

    You’ll see something like this

!Image Description
Let’s take a look!

    Go out to Solana Explorer (https://explorer.solana.com/), select the devnet as your cluster

!Image Description

    Paste your token address in the search bar and CELEBRATE!!

!Image Description
Let’s make some tokens

    At this point, we’ve created or minted our token….but we haven’t created any tokens.
    Let’s do that now.

Create a token account

    First we’ll need a token account. Why? Each Solana wallet will have individual accounts for each token it has.
    We’re creating a token account in our default wallet for our new token, Beard Coin.

spl-token create-account mnteyhFCjqLu5QwfXmEu49dGybyFN5dwPfAhoiMbjNw

!Image Description
Let’s print money

    With our token account created, let’s mint some tokens. We can make as many as we want and we can do this multiple times (as many as you would like….you’re the government now!)
    We’ll start with 1000.
    Note: You can only do this with the dad account we created. It’s the boss, only he can mint new tokens.

spl-token mint mnteyhFCjqLu5QwfXmEu49dGybyFN5dwPfAhoiMbjNw 1000

!Image Description

    Let’s check the balance of our wallet

spl-token balance mnteyhFCjqLu5QwfXmEu49dGybyFN5dwPfAhoiMbjNw

## We're rich!!

Send some tokens to a friend

    You can send to anyone with a solana wallet address.
    They will need a way to switch to the devnet to be able to see the token and balance.
    I’m going to send to one of my wallets

DONE!! You’ve just setup a token on the devnet blockchain. Again, you can stop here. But it you want to have a REAL coin that is tradeable and is on the real blockchain.
